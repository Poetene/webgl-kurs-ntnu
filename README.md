# webgl-kurs-ntnu

> Course for Abakus the 6th of November.

## Topics:

- What is WebGL?
- Why THREE.js?
- How can you create some simple 3D object, and animate it?
- How can you control these objects and the 3D camera?
  - With a web camera *(This is something everyone can do on their laptop)*
  - With Leap Motion / Kinect *(This requires an external device, probably only for demonstration)*

## What is left in the planning process?

- Decide who takes care of each topic.
- Figure out how we can make the course as hands-on as possible.

We use <http://remarkjs.com/> for our presentation.
